# Plan for Proofgrammers

## Implement New Slides for Chapter Ten, "Complexity Theory: When Efficiency Does Matter"

- You have access to the content of the book in the file:
`What-Can-Be-Computed.pdf` and `What-Can-Be-Computed.md` that is in the root of
this repository.
- You have access to the slides of the book in PPTX (which is hard for you to
read) and a QMD file (which is easier for you to read) in the
`theoreticalmachines/wcbc-slides/` directory.
- You have access to the images that were created from the slides for this
chapter. These images may be especially important because of the fact that there
are some diagrams of the output of a universal computer. You can include these
images into the slides you make by finding them in the `img.` directory that is
in the `theoreticalmachines/wcbc-slides/`. Please note that there are a lot of
images and you should only include those that are the most important.
- You have access to the source code connected to this book in the directory
`theoreticalmachines/wcbc-code/`
- I have created a template file for the slides in the
`slides/weekeleven/index.qmd`. You can add to this file! Please note that I have
already created the correct title and added the review slides from the last week
that I want you to keep in this slide deck. So, please adapt the slide about
the learning objectives to support content for this week!
- I would like you to create a starting version of the slides for Chapter Ten:
in the `slides/weekeleven/index.qmd` file. Please note that you are creating
slides for _week eleven_ of the course in the `index.qmd` file that is in that
directory but for _chapter ten_ of the book.
- Make sure to only explain concepts that are connected to Chapter Ten.
- Make sure to review all the prior slides that I have created in the `slides/`
directory and the subdirectories for prior weeks in `weekone/` and `weektwo/`
and `weekthree/` those other directories up to `weekten.` to ensure that your
slides are formatted and laid out just like the content that I have already
created.
- Do not make slides if they are not directly connected to the content in the
book, the content in the slides (i.e., the PPTX or the extracted QMD file) or in
the source code that connects to this chapter of the book.
- Make sure that you connect the slides to the theme of being a "proofgrammer"
as explained in the course syllabus that is available in `syllabus/index.qmd`.
- Make sure that the concept that you create is short, succinct, and clear. I
will be revising this content, essentially using it as a starting point.
- Please follow all the rules and regulations for creating this content and make
sure that you notify me when you have completed this task.
- You must create a similar number of slides to prior slide decks.
- You must use "signposting" slides at the subsection level that set the
stage for the content that is going to be explained about a specific topic.
- Overall, keep the same structure and length to the prior slides.
- Do not go into too much detail. Make sure that the content is accessible to
an undergraduate learner who is exploring the topic of computational complexity
for the first time.
