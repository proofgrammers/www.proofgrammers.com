## Decision

::: {.fragment style="margin-top: -0.5em; font-size: 0.8em;"} 
- {{< iconify fa6-solid lightbulb >}} **What is Decision?**
    - Accepts and halts when the string is in the
      language (positive instance).
    - Rejects and halts when the string is not in the
      language (negative instance).

## Recognition

::: {.fragment style="margin-top: -0.5em; font-size: 0.8em;"} 
- {{< iconify fa6-solid lightbulb >}} **What is "Recognition"?**
    - A language or decision problem always accepts and halts on all positive instances.
    - Either rejects and halts or loops forever when the string is not in
      the language (negative instance).
    - **Example**: A C++ compiler(g++) checks whether a program is syntactically
      correct. If the syntax is valid → it halts and accepts. If invalid →
      it may reject with an error or keep processing indefinitely.

## Similarities & Differences

::: {.fragment style="margin-top: -0.5em; font-size: 0.8em;"} 
- {{< iconify fa6-solid lightbulb >}} **What are Similarities & Differences?**
    - Similarities
      - Both guarantee correct acceptance for “Yes” instances.
      - Both are defined using Turing machines.

    - Differences
      - Decision "Always" halts in finite time, while Recognition
        "May not" halt for some inputs.
      - Decision corresponds to both ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ cases, while Recognition
        corresponds only to the ‘Yes’ case.

- Only guaranteed to receive a fruit if it's an apple
- There's a chance the machine jams if an apple isn't passing through
- A decidable version of this situation is if the result could only be an apple or orange

## Recognition is Easier than Decision

::: {.fragment style="margin-top: -0.5em; font-size: 0.8em;"} 
- {{< iconify fa6-solid lightbulb >}} **Why Recognition is Easier than Decision?**
    - Recognition try to find only positive instance; it does not care about 
      Negative instance and infinite loop. 
    - Decision try to find all possible case; it must correctly distinguish
      all cases (both yes- and no-instances)

# What is RecYesOnString?

::: {.fragment style="margin-top: -0.5em; font-size: 0.8em;"} 
- {{< iconify fa6-solid lightbulb >}} **What is RecYesOnString?**
    - Takes two inputs: a Python program P as a string and an input string I.
    - Runs the program P with I as the input: P(I)
    - Outcomes:
      - If P halts and prints "yes", then RecYesOnString prints "yes".
      - If P halts and does not print "yes", then RecYesOnString prints "no".
      - If P does not halt, then RecYesOnString does not halt.

# RecYesOnString Program

```{pyodide}
# This can be found in the "What Can Be Computed?" book.

# returns: If P(I) is 'yes', returns 'yes'. If P(I) terminates but
# does not return 'yes', then 'no' is returned. If P(I) enters an
# infinite loop, this program also enters an infinite loop.

import utils; from utils import rf
from universal import universal  
def recYesOnString(inString):
    (progString, newInString) = utils.DESS(inString) 
    val = universal(progString, newInString)  
    if val == 'yes':
        return 'yes'
    else:
        return 'no'

# Recognizes, but Does Not Decide

::: {.fragment style="margin-top: -0.5em; font-size: 0.8em;"} 
- {{< iconify fa6-solid lightbulb >}} **How does this Recognize and not Decide?**
    - RecYesOnString only considers the positive instance of the YesOnString program. 
    - If anything but the positive instance is returned, then RecYesOnString returns "no".
    - This is different than deciding, since deciding a program requires the program to halt: choosing either "yes" or "no".
