# Notes for our presentation

## What is lastTtoA?

A basic Turing Machine that is defined in a way that the last t in a string -which comes as an input- will be mutated to an A. For this Turing Machine we will need three states: Q0, Q1, and Qhalt. So our list of instruction will look like this: L = {Q0, Q1, Qhalt}. We will need to implement transition function(s) except for Qhalt since the machine will halt on that state always.
