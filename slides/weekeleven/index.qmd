# Learning objectives

::: {.fragment .callout-note icon=true title="Learning Objectives for Theoretical Machines"}

- **CS-204-1**: Use both intuitive analysis and theoretical proof
techniques to correctly distinguish between problems that are tractable,
intractable, and uncomputable.
- **CS-204-2**: Correctly use one or more variants of the Turing machine
(TM) abstraction to both describe and analyze the solution to a
computational problem.
- **CS-204-3**: Correctly use one or more variants of the finite state
machine (FSM) abstraction to describe and analyze the solution to a
computational problem.
- **CS-204-4**: Use a formal proof technique to correctly classify a
problem according to whether or not it is in the P, NP, NP-Hard, and/or
NP-Complete complexity class(es).
- **CS-204-5**: Apply insights from theoretical proofs concerning the
limits of either program feasibility or complexity to the implementation
of both correct and efficient real-world Python programs.
